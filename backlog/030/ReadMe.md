# Demo

- **Form Introduction**
  - Build a simple login form (text[name=username], password[name=password], input[type=submit]) to cover the basics of form submission (e.g. submit event listener, prevent default behaviour, etc.) and how to access and work with form elements (i.e. event.target.elements)
    - Perform some basic form validation on the fields:
      - [ ] username must be contain at least one '@' symbol
      - [ ] password must be between 6 and 10 characters in length
    - And utilize a class for updating the form fields display when a field is invalid (e.g. add error class that makes the border red)

# Practice

- Have students work through posted forms exercise, and complete as homework if necessary
