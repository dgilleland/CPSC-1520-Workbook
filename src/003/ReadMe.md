## Live-Demo Walkthrough

Before beginning this walkthrough, you should know how to take screenshots. One free tool available for this is [**TechSmith Capture**](https://www.techsmith.com/jing-tool.html) (formerly named "Jing", by the makers of *SnagIt*). Another is the [**Snipping Tool**](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/use-snipping-tool-to-capture-screenshots-00246869-1843-655f-f220-97299b865f6b) tool built into Windows 10/11.

1. Open your web browser and navigate to any website. (The contents of the website are irrelevant to this walkthrough.)
1. Open the browser's Developer Tools and select the console. In here, you will be entering JavaScript code as directed by your instructor.
1. Take screen-shots of your own work in the console to demonstrate your use of the console in the browser. Place those images in this folder and edit this document to show those images below.
1. Commit these changes to your repository and synchronize it with the copy on GitHub.

   *This is the last time you will be explicitly asked to commit your changes and synchronize with GitHub. At this point, **you will be expected to make your own commits on a regular basis for each lesson**.*
