# Scripting Basics and JavaScript Functions

*At the end of this topic, you should be able to...*

- Create external JavaScript files that can be referenced via a `<script>` tag
- Discuss the placement of the `<script>` tag in HTML and the concerns/issues that developers should be aware of that dictate when to place in the head vs body element
- Define the term **concatenation**
- Construct strings using concatenation of string literals and variables
- Define the term **function** in JavaScript
- Use the built-in `alert()` and `prompt()` functions to interact with the user
- Identify various built-in functions
- Describe the basic syntax of a function declaration
- Distinguish between functions that return values and those that don't
- Describe what is meant by a **function signature**
- Describe what is meant by the term **function body**
- Define the term **block-statement**

CPSC1520 Week 2 Lesson Plan

Class 1
Linking Scripts
•	Introduce directory structure
•	Discuss <script> tag placement and concerns/issues that developers should be aware of that dictate when to place in the head vs body element.
1.	End of <body> for efficiency
2.	In the <head> if required
Concatenation
•	Practice with prompt() to get user input and concatenate with a message for output to the document
o	Go through greet_user example
Class 2
Intro to Functions
•	Discuss built-in functions (e.g. console.log) already used and how they work
•	Basics of function declaration (declared functions vs expressions)
o	Parameters
o	Return values
•	Basics of calling functions
o	Arguments
•	Scope
o	Variable access
•	Create a function to take care of the concatenation message display done in the previous example
o	Go through function_intro and function_intro_params examples
•	Have students work through the posted functions exercise for homework
Class 3
In-Class Assessment [Functions]
Have students work through in-class assessment, which must be completed by the end of class (only release the in-class assessment in class on this day on the projector; DO NOT release through Moodle).
Quiz
Students must complete Quiz 1 by the end of this week.
