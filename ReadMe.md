# CPSC-1520 - **Student Workbook** (Sep 2021)

> **STUDENT_NAME** - Place your name in this line.

This repository is your **Student Workbook** for participating in the in-class demos and for completing practice homework; the coding work is to be placed in the [*`src/`*](./src/ReadMe.md) folder. Learning Outcomes ([**LOGs**](./docs/logs/ReadMe.md)) and other useful notes can be found in the [**docs** folder](./docs), such as links to the [Reading Materials](./docs/Readings.md) for the course. Also, you are encouraged to use the [**docs/mynotes**](./docs/mynotes/ReadMe.md) folder to record your notes from each class.

> :warning: **Do *NOT*** use this repository for any assignments that are worth marks. For work worth marks in this course, only use repositories set up/approved by your instructor. :warning:

Additionally, you can find online notes at the course's [Moodle site](https://moodle.nait.ca) and on the unofficial [website notes](https://cpsc-1520.github.io). Also be sure to checkout out the topical [**Learning Outcomes**](https://cpsc-1520.github.io/LOGs.html) used in class.

## ![Version Control](./docs/images/tasks.png) Version Control

At the end of the term, your repositories on this [CPSC-1520 GitHub Organization](https://github.com/CPSC-1520) will be removed. You will still have access to your local versions of these repositories for your personal use and review.

> :warning: **Do *NOT*** re-publish your assignment/assessment repositories - doing so with any materials worth marks is an act of academic dishonesty :warning:
