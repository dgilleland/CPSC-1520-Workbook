## ![Inside This Repo](./docs/images/level.png) Inside this repository

This repository is your **Student Workbook** for participating in the in-class demos and for completing practice homework; the coding work is to be placed in the [*`src/`*](./src/ReadMe.md) folder. Learning Outcomes ([**LOGs**](./docs/logs/ReadMe.md)) and other useful notes can be found in the [**docs** folder](./docs), such as links to the [Reading Materials](./docs/Readings.md) for the course. Also, you are encouraged to use the [**docs/mynotes**](./docs/mynotes/ReadMe.md) folder to record your notes from each class.

> :warning: **Do *NOT*** use this repository for any assignments that are worth marks. For work worth marks in this course, only use repositories set up/approved by your instructor. :warning:

The course's [Brightspace site](https://lms.nait.ca/d2l/home) contains official information. An *ad-hoc* site for tutorials, references, etc. has been set up by your instructor for this final Jan 2025 offering of this course: [**dgilleland.github.io/CPSC-1520/**](https://dgilleland.github.io/CPSC-1520/).

## ![Version Control](./docs/images/tasks.png) Version Control

At the end of the term, your repositories on the [CPSC-1520 GitHub Organization](https://github.com/CPSC-1520) will be removed. You will still have access to your local versions of these repositories for your personal use and review.

> :warning: **Do *NOT*** re-publish your assignment/assessment repositories - doing so with any materials worth marks is an act of academic dishonesty :warning:

## ![Software et.al.](./docs/images/code.png) Software & Resources

> *Do you need step-by-step instructions for installing the software? Check out this [**System Setup**](https://dgilleland.github.io/CPSC-1520/tutorials/0010/) tutorial.*

**Required** books, videos, tools, etc. for this course include:

- **Software**
  - [**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com) (see [Notes](#vs-code-extensions) on VS Code extensions) - This is the preferred editor for working in almost any programming language.
    - [**Live Server**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) Extension
  - [**git**](https://git-scm.com/downloads) - This is the beating heart of **Version Control**, something that you will work with every day. Second only to your editor in terms of usage, it's indispensible for managing your development in teams or on your own.
  - [**node**](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which includes **npm**) - Node is a run-time that allows you to use JavaScript on the web server. It comes along with npm (*Node Package Manager*), a package-management tool for the command line that allows you to integrate 3rd-party libraries with your application.
  - [**pnpm**](https://pnpm.io) - An alternative to Node's built-in `npm` tool, `pnpm` is much faster and more efficient to use.
  - [**GitHub CLI**](https://cli.github.com/) (*Command-Line Interface*) - A tool for interacting with your GitHub repository on the command line.
- **Accounts/Services**
  - [**GitHub**](https://github.com) - Core to everything you will do, this service handles cloud hosting of your repositories and so, so much more!
- **Books/Videos**
  - Refer to [Readings.md](./docs/Readings.md) in the docs folder for official and recommended reading materials. Also, take a look at the [LanguageRef.md](./docs/LanguageRef.md) doc.

Other recommended resources include:
